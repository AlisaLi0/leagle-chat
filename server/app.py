"""leagle-chat backend — conversational retrieval over real US case law.

Boundary (hard rule): the LLM is ONLY a conversational front-end for SEARCH.
It turns the user's plain-English question into a precise query, and organizes
the *retrieved real cases* into a readable answer with citations. It never
invents cases and never gives a legal conclusion ("you will win/lose"). What
the user receives is always real primary-source material from CourtListener
plus citation links — not model-generated legal content.

Flow per turn:
  1. route()    — LLM turns the question into {action: search|clarify, query, court}
  2. if clarify — ask one clarifying question, stop (no search yet)
  3. search()   — CourtListener returns REAL cases
  4. organize() — LLM streams an answer grounded ONLY in those cases, citing [n]

Graceful degradation: if the LLM endpoint is unreachable, retrieval still works
(query falls back to the raw question; the real cases are returned without the
LLM's organizing layer). The product's core — real cases — never depends on the
model being up.
